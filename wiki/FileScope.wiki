FileScope - Web server reconnaissance tool.

_*About*_

FileScope uses a wordlist to brute force directories and files for web servers where indexing has been disabled. This will recursively scan directories found and make a log of all successful HTTP requests.

_*Depends*_

use Term::ANSIColor (Perl)
use LWP::UserAgent (Perl)

_*Manual*_

Usage: ./FileScope < ARGS >
Arguments:
  -f < wordlist >
  -u < URL >
  -s < Seconds to sleep between requests >
  -t < File types, comma separated, e.g.: js,pdf,txt,psd >
  -r (make search recursive)
